# StarWarsWiki

A small scale app that fetches data from https://swapi.dev/api
- it displays the movie list sorted by release date (earliest first)
- clicking on a movie displays movie details including the movie crawl in the form of an Animation (i used a 3rd party lib called StarWars that mimics the real crawl format from each movie)
  
- there is also a list of characters displayed in ascending order which toggles when you click the header of the list 
- at the bottom of the list is a footer that displays the total number of characters in the list
and the total height ogf the characters
  
- the gender filter spec was not implemented due to time constraints from my side, the toggle on the UI is interactive but unfortunately does not toggle the characters displayed in the list based on their gender

find below link for the live demo app built via app center (I could not use the prescribed web resources for demos as the app was crashing due to some libraries not being web friendly)
